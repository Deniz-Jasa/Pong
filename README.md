# Pong
I've created a 2D game of Pong from scratch in C/C++ with the use of the Allegro game and graphics library. The object of the game is for a player to earn more points than the opponent. Points are earned when the opponent fails to return the ball to the other player. In this version of the game you can play against various computer levels or with a friend! This version of Pong builds on top of the original game from 1972 with new game modes, complex computer algorithms, and dynamic ball movement
